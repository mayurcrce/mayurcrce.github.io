                           Butter Chicken is one of the most popular curries at any Indian restaurant around the world. Aromatic golden chicken pieces in an incredible creamy curry sauce, this Butter Chicken recipe is one of the best you will try! You will love how easy it is to make in the comfort of your own home, especially with garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread.Tender and juicy chicken thanks to a deliciously spiced yogurt marinade, Butter Chicken is ridiculously easy to make. The curry sauce is out of this world!

							I know you all love food with beautiful, bold flavours, and nothing beats sitting down to a good great curry to finish off a chaotic day. The aromas alone transport you to a completely different world.

							The best part about cooking up Butter Chicken at home is the ingredients list. Every ingredient is easy to find from any grocery store or supermarket.Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, you may notice that Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani — chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala.

							Prepared in a buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. Most restaurants are known to add in copious amounts of butter, which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick of grease.

							However, we found while recipe testing that we prefer to start the sauce off in Ghee (clarified butter, or you can use a combination of half regular butter and half oil).

							Adding cream at the end of cooking provides enough of that richness you look for in an authentic butter chicken. Our less oily version leaves you feeling good and satisfied.A milder curry when compared to other Indian curries makes Butter Chicken a favourite among families with little ones. You can certainly add as much or as little chili as you wish. In other words, YOU are in total control of how spicy you make it.

							As mentioned above, the juicy and tender, flavour infused chicken starts with an easy yogurt marinade made from scratch: plain yogurt, fresh garlic and ginger, and easy to find spices.

							You can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts. We prefer dark meat, but go with what you like.It’s all about that sauce when it comes to authentic butter chicken. You’ll be surprised to find that you only need an onion, a can of crushed tomatoes, garlic and ginger, and some added spices to continue those beautiful flavours in the sauce.

							The trick to making a great sauce is to let the tomatoes cook off for at least 10-15 minutes, until they are almost dry on your pan. Additionally, you can add in a couple tablespoons of water if it dries to early.

							After that, blend until smooth and add in your cream (heavy whipping cream or thickened cream). You can use evaporated milk or half and half for a lower calorie option.The beauty of this gravy/sauce is that you can prepare it ahead of time if you want or need to. Allow it to cool completely, store it in an airtight glass jar or container and refrigerate for up to 48 hours.

							Those deep flavours will have plenty of time to develop and shine through before adding your chicken. Of course, this is completely optional.

							If there’s any Indian recipe that’s worth making at home, its Butter Chicken, and this is the BEST butter chicken you’ll make!

                            A type of red meat cut from carcasses of cattle that are raised, butchered, and processed for human consumption. Some of the common registered beef breeds listed in order of the numbers registered include: Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, Charolais, Shorthorn, Santa Gertrudis, Brahman, Brangus, and Red Angus. Speciality breeds are also being developed that are used for breeding stock to improve characteristics of other breeds and as food stock to be raised for providing higher quality meat cuts. Examples of some of the cattle breeds being raised as breed stock include Simmental, Gelbvieh, Fleckvieh, Limousin and Chianina, while Wagyu is an example of a breed being raised as a higher quality food stock.
Cuts of beef are obtained from a cow (female that has delivered a calf), a heifer (female that has not delivered a calf), a young steer (castrated male), or a bull (less than 2 years old). Each main beef cut is known as a primal cut, which consists of groups of muscles from the same area of the carcass. Primal cuts are also called wholesale cuts, because they are usually sold to meat markets to be cut into smaller beef cuts for sale to the consumer. An example of a primal cut is the short loin. Smaller cuts of beef are taken from the primal cuts and are known as subprimal cuts. An example of a subprimal cut is the tenderloin, which is cut from the short loin. The subprimal cuts of beef can yield still smaller cuts such as filet mignon steaks from the tenderloin. Many of the subprimal cuts of beef, and the smaller cuts obtained from them, are known as consumer cuts, retail cuts, or market ready cuts.
Beef cuts may consist of a single muscle, such as the tenderloin, while others may be a cross section of several muscles. A Porterhouse steak, for example, is a cross section of parts of the top loin and tenderloin muscles. Many cross section cuts include some bone.
Cuts of beef that are obtained from the center of the animal, such as the loin and rib area, are the most tender. This is because the muscles in the loin and rib areas are suspension muscles and do not move as much as the muscles in the front and rear portions of the animal, which are responsible for locomotion. Beef cuts obtained from locomotion muscles are lean, but much tougher than suspension muscles.
Various cuts of beef may differ in name between different countries and even in different regions of the same country, so it can be confusing. For example, in the United States, the rear section of the carcass is known as the round, but in Canada, the same section is called the hip.
Cuts of American beef are graded by government (USDA) standards and labeled with one of the following designations: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, and Cutter/Canner. A number of factors are considered when beef is graded, such as the texture of the meat, the quantity of fat within the meat, and the proportion of bone in relation to the meat. Prime grades are available to restaurants and some food markets, while Choice, Select, and Standard cuts are commonly available in many food stores. Commercial, Utility and Cutter/Canner grades are most often processed for use in manufacturing a variety of canned and packaged meat products such as luncheon meat, sausages, and jerky.
As a guide for selecting beef, lean boneless cuts yield up to 4 servings per pound while beef cuts with some bone yield up to 3 servings per pound. Bony cuts yield no more than 1 ½ servings per pound. One serving of a rib roast is equal to half a rib, so if you will be serving 8 people, a 4 rib roast should be purchased. 16 ounces (one pound) of ground beef produces about 4 cooked 3-ounce servings, which is the serving size recommended for a healthy diet.
When thawing beef, it is easier to cut it before it is fully defrosted. After cutting, the beef should be refrigerated until it has fully thawed. Fresh raw beef that has not been frozen can be placed in the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up a bit, making slicing much easier. Beef that is not fully defrosted should not be cooked because the exterior of the beef may become overdone before the interior has had a chance to cook to the proper temperature.
Aged beef is a product that has been specially processed and stored to improve the flavor and texture of the meat. Typically, sides of beef or primal cuts are selected for aging, which involves placing the meat in refrigerated temperatures that average approximately 35ºF/1.66ºC for 4 to 6 weeks. In controlled refrigeration, moisture within the meat begins to evaporate while the enzymes within the flesh soften the connective tissues. Thus, the flavor of the meat is improved as the meat becomes increasingly tender. Due to the wide ranges of temperature and humidity that may be present in consumer level refrigerators, aging beef in this manner at home is not recommended.
When cooking beef, the USDA recommends that whole beef cuts be cooked to a safe internal temperature of not less than 145°F/62.77ºC. Traditional guidelines usually state that medium rare beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of no higher than 130°F/54.4ºC, but with increased concern over bacteria that may be present in the internal portions of beef, it may be risky to consume beef that has not cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145°F/62.77ºC.

                        <p>
                            Sushi, considered to be an artistic and highly skilled Japanese cuisine, is now so common and popular that you can walk right into your local grocery store and pick up a take-away package of sushi to eat at home while binge-watching Netflix. And whether it’s from the comfort of your couch or dining at a five-star restaurant, there’s no denying sushi’s popularity around the world. 

So, what is sushi? It’s a Japanese style of food that uses fish (raw or cooked), vegetables, and is often combined with rice that’s been seasoned with vinegar. Pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce are usually served on the side. 

The sushi we know today is a far cry from where it began. The original sushi was once a staple dish around various regions of Asia and was salted fish preserved in fermented rice. In fact, the word “sushi” roughly means “sour” as a nod to its fermented origins. This style of sushi was common in Japan until the end of the Edo period, when it evolved into Edomae zushi, a style of sushi closer to what we eat today. Developed by Hanaya Yohei, this sushi was larger, used fresh fish, was prepared quickly and meant to be eaten with the hands. 

Contemporary sushi uses vinegared rice topped with fish, meat, and vegetables, mixing traditional and sometimes untraditional ingredients. There are a variety of styles of sushi you can order, and yes, there is a difference between Japanese-style sushi and Western-style sushi.Chirashi, meaning, “scattered,” is a bowl of vinegared rice topped with a mix of raw fish (typically chef’s choice) and various garnishes. It’s fast and easy to make, and convenient to eat. In Japan the toppings vary depending on the region where it’s being served and is often eaten on Hinamatsuri, Girls Day or Doll Day, a special day in Japan celebrated on March 3rd.

Maki
Maki is cut rolled sushi, traditionally made with a sheet of nori, wrapped around a layer of rice, vegetables, and fish, then rolled up using a special bamboo mat, and cut into 6-8 pieces. There are a variety of maki sushi rolls you can order which range in size and style. 

Futomaki are larger sized rolls filled with a number of ingredients. 
Hosomaki are smaller rolls made with a sheet of nori, rolled up with a layer of rice, but contain only a single filling, such as cucumbers, tuna or carrots. 
Temaki are hand rolls, which are made by rolling a sheet of nori into a cone shape, then filling with rice and vegetables and fish. Temaki are eaten with the hands because they’re too big to eat with chopsticks.
Gunkanmaki, also known as battleship sushi, it’s formed by wrapping nori (roasted seaweed) around a ball of vinegared rice so that a well is created that can be filled with ingredients like oysters, ikura (salmon roe), tobiko (flying fish roe) or uni (sea urchin roe).
echnically not sushi! While sushi is fish that is served with rice and may be adorned with other ingredients, sashimi is simply the raw fish, served as is. It’s sliced in long rectangular slices known as “hira-zukuri” and may have wasabi, soy sauce and ginger served on the side as accompanying condiments. There are several types of sushi, making it an appealing food to people with a wide range of tastes. One form of sushi, nigiri-zushi, are hand-formed mounds of rice with a dab of wasabi topped with various ingredients. Popular nigiri-zushi include maguro (tuna), toro (belly of tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), and ebi (shrimp).

Maki-zushi is the Japanese name for sushi rolls. A sheet of nori (dried seaweed) is layered with sushi rice, and a row of fish and vegetables. The sheet is then tightly rolled with a makisu. After that the roll is sliced into pieces, plated, and served. Rolls such as these are called norimaki.
